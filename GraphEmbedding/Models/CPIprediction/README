This paper was excluded from the review because of the declarations from the authors:

Important: this repository will not be further developed and maintained because we have shown 
and believe that graph neural networks or graph convolutional networks are incorrect and useless for
modeling molecules (see our paper in NeurIPS 2020). Please consider switching to our new and simple
machine learning model called quantum deep field.
